# Node.js based Game website
Designed and coded a game and website. The website included an
encoded user login that saves the user's account and allows the
user to register an account, which enables them to login
frequently. In addition, the website contained two unity games
that I desgined which allowed the user to play directly on the web
engine without having to download.
